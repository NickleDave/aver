For a brief introduction to active vision models, and how they relate to the typical tasks 
used to investigate visual search in the laboratory, please see 
[this notebook](./doc/notebooks/fvf-model-results.ipynb). The notebook contains results 
from a replication of an active vision-type model described in the Hulleman and Olivers 
commentary cited above.
